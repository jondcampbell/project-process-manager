project-process-manager
=======================

Based on the Laravel 4 Vagrant https://github.com/bryannielsen/Laravel4-Vagrant

This is my first laravel project, attempting a very customized project management application which eventually hopefully with use backbone for a lot of the front end. Started off with some scaffolding and will be piecing it together as I go. Lots of features planned but will be time consuming(and fun) process to get there.

**Working on:**
Not sure if my process type field should line up with a project type or not. It could make it so when we choose a project type it shows the possible processes for that project type. But maybe we need types of processes as somsething different than the type or project.

Need to add StatusUpdates table and controller very soon

Need to add some more data to the database soon so it isnt as empty
